# Decimal to Binary Converter with Recursion - Certification Project

## Overview
This project is part of the certification requirements. In this project, I built a Decimal to Binary Converter using recursion in JavaScript. The main goal is to explore the concept of recursion by breaking down a decimal number conversion into smaller sub-problems, and visualizing the process through animation.

## Project Details
- **Project Type**: Algorithm Visualization Tool
- **Purpose**: Convert decimal numbers to binary using recursion, and visually demonstrate the recursive process.
- **Skills Learned**: JavaScript recursion, call stack behavior, algorithm visualization

## Features
- 🔁 **Recursive Conversion**: Converts any non-negative decimal number to its binary representation using a recursive function.
- 👀 **Visual Call Stack**: Displays a step-by-step animation of how recursion works behind the scenes.
- 🧠 **Learning Tool**: Designed to help understand and internalize recursion through interactivity and visuals.
- 💡 **User Input**: Users can enter their own decimal values to observe custom conversions.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Input structure and layout
- **CSS**: Styling and animation design
- **JavaScript**: Recursive logic, input handling, and animation control

## Installation
To try the recursion visualizer:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
